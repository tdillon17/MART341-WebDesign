1. The margin is the space between the box and the element. Padding is the space
between the inner content of the element. The border is a container.

with trying to get the white border around my table. It kept showing up above.
Once I got that figured out I started having problems with aligning the images with
the text of the webpage. That's pretty much what I did for 3 hours trying
to figure out size, ems, and tags that may possibly help, they did not. I just
could not get through this week.
