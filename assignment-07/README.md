1. I've come across all forms. A lot of it was data mining, and others
were for things like surveys, applying for jobs, or taking a moodle quiz.
2. Text box is where users can type information available to the browser.
Check boxes allow users to select zero, one or more options.
The submit button sends a form to the server.
3. This is the first assignment that went pretty smoothly. I may have tricked
myself into thinking I might be good at this. I'm also glad I found out how to create
extra space in the code so that everything was not squished together on the webpage.
