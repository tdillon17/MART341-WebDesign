I visited the Yahoo website. It looked more like the search engine it was meant to be.
The Yahoo website has completely changed it now looks like a tabloid magazine.
I'm going with full unabashed honesty. I don't remember what I've learned. This class is very difficult for me and I am constantly on the verge of a breakdown when I am working on assignments. I still can't figure out how to embed images despite watching multiple tutorials multiple times. My about page won't link to my index page despite my index page linking without a problem. I am following every step of the tutorials and none of it is working out.
