1. My imaginary client was Jill and Scott Cupcake Shop. They described their Shop
is an ode to pastels and pink. They bake cupcakes only and although they have
a regular cupcake menu they are known for their quirky custom cupcakes. They wanted the site
highlight all three aspects.
2. Mobile first design is important because it was projected that there are
3.5 million mobile users. The majority of users are using their phones to find
the content that they need.
3. I don't know where to begin with the number of challenges I've had working on
the site. I spent a lot of time working on things that I did not use like a background
image. Then the crazy amount of time I spent trying to get the menu text under
the four images. I pretty much overcame them by giving up after an hour or two of trying.
I also had some issue with linking my font and style sheets. This was fixed by
noticing I misspelled style and that my "font" folder was actually "fonts".
