1. System fonts are fonts already installed in your computer.
web fonts are a css feature that allow you to download the font with the website.
web safe fonts are fonts that appear across operating systems.
2. If a browser fails to load the primary font fallback fonts and font stacks
will try to load before the browser defaults to serif font.
3. This week was not so bad. The homework overview video really helped. My
biggest challenge was the pseudo elements. I put them in the font sheet hahaha!
