        <p>"You are not alone. Yes! I get it, the struggle is real.Many times in
        life you get to these plateus and you hate where you are. Once you reach
        that plateau, you feel as if you will be stuck there forever. You've
        put in so much hard work; you've shed so many tears; you've tried to do
        everything right like everyone suggested, but you still find yourself
        staring hardship and despair in the face. A lot of times you sweep these
        feelings under the rug and try to go on your merry way as if nothing
        bothers you, but truth be told--you're dying inside."</p>

      <div class="second-paragraph">
        "You may be at a point in your life where you are either trying to
        complete school, starting a new job, pursuing a career or business opportunity,
        attempting to prove yourself on your school's team, or just trying to
        figure out your purpose in life. No matter where you are, please
        understand me when I say, YOU ARE NOT ALONE! you might be thinking
        "Richard, you don't know me personally", and you would be right. What I do know
        is that you and I bleed the same blood, fear failure, and work toward the same
        goal of a better life than what we were born into."
      </div>

      &nbsp;
      <div class="third-paragraph">
        "Beyond that, I understand where you are because I have struggled
        with the feeling of being alone from time to time. I've worked hard to
        make my dreams become reality, and I've felt at times that the more
        I pushed, the more resistance came."
