  <p>I really did not know what to do with the final. I couldn't think of
  anything super creative that wouldn't drive me crazy, so I decided to show
some of the random skills. I kept it simple and sweet I only have
a week between now and my final semester. I'm taking 6 courses this summer.
5 being lecture and 1 being an independant study where I create a podcast. Life
has been stressful and I am dealing with a lot of change, but I know I'll
survive it, I always do. Here's a poem I wrote:</p>

  <h1>An Ode to the BART Station</h1>
</div>
<div class="" id="custom">
  <p>We’ve traveled the world together when the sun and moon were young</p>
<p>Your thoughts couldn’t brace themselves for my smiles</p>
<p>Your black and gold crown was always meant to outshine my rusty shackles</p>
<p>Tell me, does this train make a stop at our hearts?</p>
<p>We split at the ocean thinking our coasts will someday realign</p>
<p>Clocks turned for 1,576,800 minutes before your hand reached for my words</p>
<p>But my smile disappeared despite your summer trying to catch my fall</p>
<p>Tell me, can we take the train back to what never was?</p>
<p>I cherish our memories like my favorite book that will remain unread</p>
<p>My Dearest Friend: A love story that will never be written</p>
<p>It’s a shame the world we traveled does not exist between us</p>
