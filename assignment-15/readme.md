1. Everything I know about the web and web development I learned in this course.
I'm pretty sure I've mentioned before my struggles with my myspace profile back
in the day. I technically didn't know what the internet was. Which is just a
wire in the ground.
2. Everything Tom from myspace failed to teach me about web design I learned in
this course. I've been using design software for more than a decade so I knew
about fonts and colors, but applying them to code was a whole new world for me.
3. When the semester began I was freaking out about this course. I didn't
know anything about coding, I didn't think I had the brain capacity to learn it
and I struggled a lot. It was a lot of work but I made it through and now I
know exactly what I am looking at when things are wrong with my office website,
or I can tell someone the problem with our online application and why the
signatures aren't working. I can honestly say this is the first class I've taken  
in a long time that I actually got something out of. I know I took the easy way
out a lot as far as creativity but this class was definitely worth
the emotional break downs.
