1. Learning html had its ups and a lot of downs. It was all new to me since
I draw and paint. Learning all of this is interesting but sometimes I think my brain
is at full capacity and I'm not sure of what I'm looking at.
2. I am not remotely excited about learning CSS. I am having such a hard time
getting my sections to separate when using div tags. It's become frustrating,
I hate that I don't have more time in my week to try to get a better understanding.
3. I don't know why the div tags work for others but essentially tell me to go
 to hell every week. I feel like I'm sixteen again trying to redo my myspace
 page and failing all over again. This time I don't have my best friend who  
 actually knew how to code do it for me. I've looked up so many different
 ways to fix it and tried different elements and tags and none of it worked.
The only thing I can say that I successfully did this week was
link all of my pages after having a slight issue.
