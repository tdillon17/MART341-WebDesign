1. I chose bootstrap it was just easier for me since I lost four days of work
to drill.
2. I used a local file. I didn't really have time to work on this assignment and I
did not want to mess up further than I already have
3. HTML 5 has helped build a more diverse and powerful web with new elements
attributes and behaviors.
4. This week was hard since I had to report to drill on last Thursday and had a sound
design final due the day before. This felt rushed and I don't understand the material.
I definitely don't understand how bootstrap is supposed to work and I don't if my
linking it worked since it destroyed my site once I removed the original stylesheet.
Also, the drawing shapes I don't get, I couldn't figure out how to move them
I watched three youtube videos and still could not get it done.
