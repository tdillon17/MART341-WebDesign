1. The universal selector is used to style every element on the page.
The element selector is used to select certain element types.
The class element is used to select elements that serve the same function.
The ID selector defines rules for the style of a specific element.
2. I chose light cyan ( #c3f6f7, 195, 246, 247), lime green (#32cd32, 50,205.50)
safety orange (#ff6700, 255, 103, 0) and yellow (#FFF200, 255, 255, 0). I chose
these colors because cross colors were big in the 90s. I also wanted to give the
old Nickelodeon nostalgia feel.
3. The difficulty I had this week is the  same as last week. I spent two
days trying to get the link to my style to work. I watched the overview video four
times, I looked at forums and none of the solutions worked for me. I looked
at the course site so many times, tried to get answers on discord, I watched
youtube videos I even tried the practice sites a lot. Eventually I received help
and I needed to add a period before my forward slash. I hate how simple that
solution was.
